### Problem Statement

Conversational user interfaces are becoming increasingly used for a variety of research needs.
Some are voice-activated (such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Now), but many are text-oriented chatbots appearing as assistants in the context of a larger application.
At Lexis, text chatbots are being considered for providing help in using our products, but also for improving the legal research experience
Given a set of case law and judge data, answer research questions using a text-oriented, conversational interface.
For instance, if a user asks "List cases for Judge Lucy Koh", the system would respond with a list of cases where Judge Koh is listed as a presiding judge.
